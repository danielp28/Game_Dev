A repo for my practice in game dev in  cpp


# 3D Graphics Engine
This is a 3D graphics engine created in the Windows console using One Lone Coder's ConsoleGameEngine. Currently (4/14/2020), this project contains a rotating 3D cube, nothing special. It will be built on.

# Snake
This is a really simple Snake clone runnning in the Windows console. There are a few issues with this program, mainly the lack of double buffering causes severe screen flicker during gameplay. Was a fun intro into C++ and creating simple logic for games.


# Fun With Vertices
This is an extention of what I began in the 3D Graphics Engine directory. This is a fully 3D word modeled using One Lone Coder's ConsoleGameEngine. The letters were all created by passing sets of vertices to the engine to create right triangles, which in turn create the "3D" letters that we see in the console. This was fun practice for thinking in the 3D space, getting used to using cardinal directions in a virtual enviornment, and a solid introduction into OLC's engine and it's functionality.
